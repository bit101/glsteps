# GL Steps

This repo is just a set of example OpenGL applications done in [go-gl](https://github.com/go-gl/gl) as I learn my way around the technology.

There are a couple of useful resources that I've been working with:

- [https://learnopengl.com/Introduction](https://learnopengl.com/Introduction) - a great reference, but written in C, so every single line has to be translated to Go, and that is not super easy. But super useful as a general guide.
- [https://kylewbanks.com/blog/tutorial-opengl-with-golang-part-1-hello-opengl](https://kylewbanks.com/blog/tutorial-opengl-with-golang-part-1-hello-opengl) - This one is specific to `go-gl`, but goes off in the direction of making a Conway's game of life application, so doesn't go too deep into any GL topics beyond making a white square. That said, for getting that far, it was indispensible. Thank you!

But even with those as guides, there are SO many steps involved just with drawing a single triangle to the screen. Very difficult to no where to start. So I started breaking it down to the absolutely bare-bones minimum, making sure I understood that, and adding as little else as I could add in a single unit of understanding. Here's where I'm at so far:

- [Step 1](step01/step01.go)
- [Step 2](step02/step02.go)
- [Step 3](step03/step03.go)
- [Step 4](step04/step04.go)
- [Step 5](step05/step05.go)
- [Step 6](step06/step06.go)
- [Step 7](step07/step07.go)
